  'The Common European Framework of Reference for Language skills (CEFR) is an international standard for describing language ability. It describes language ability on a six-point scale, from A1 for beginners, up to C2 for those who have mastered a language. In particupar to reading proficiency, the CEFR self-assessment grids describes the six levels as such: Reading A1: "I can understand familiar names, words and very simple sentences, for example on notices and posters or in catalogues." Reading A2: "I can read very short, simple texts. I can find specific, predictable information in simple everyday material such as advertisements, prospectuses, menus and timetables and I can understand short simple personal letters." Reading B1: "I can understand texts that consist mainly of high frequency everyday or job-related language. I can understand the description of events, feelings and wishes in personal letters." Reading B2: "I can read articles and reports concerned with contemporary problems in which the writers adopt particular attitudes or viewpoints. I can understand contemporary literary prose." Reading C1: "I can understand long and complex factual and literary texts, appreciating distinctions of style. I can understand specialised articles and longer technical instructions, even when they do not relate to my field." Reading C2: "I can read with ease virtually all forms of the written language, including abstract, structurally or linguistically complex texts such as manuals, specialised articles and literary works." Your task is to rewrite a reading lesson to the level of difficulty as described by the CEFR.';
